                <p class="knewave">Snack Tips:</p>
                
                <p>Carbohydrates are the major source of fuel for muscles.  Athletes should consume high quality carbs throughout the day to maintain optimum energy levels.</p>
                
                <p>High quality carbs are whole wheat bread, oatmeal and barley (cereals), rice, potatoes, beans, dried fruit, and fresh fruit.</p>
                
                <p>Consuming high quality lean protein throughout the day is essential for effective recovery and repair of damaged muscle tissue.</p>
                
                <p>High quality lean sources of protein are meats that are grilled, baked, or broiled, fish, chicken, turkey, seafood, egg whites, and lean beef such as round, sirloin, and fillet.</p>
                
                <p>Saturated fats and trans fat are not a good source of energy and will negatively affect your overall health and performance.  Foods that are fried, fatty pieces of meat, and processed foods should be limited and or avoided.  However good fats such as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat are good for you and provide fuel you need for endurance and stamina. Foods such as avocados, nuts (almonds, walnuts, cashews), seeds (sunflower/pumpkin), and salmon are great sources of fat.</p>
                
                <p><span class="knewave">Drink plenty of fluids.</span>  This will help prevent dehydration, fatigue, and muscle cramps.  This is extremely important before, during, and after a game practice or workout. Always remember, under eating or not eating enough calories is not a safe and recommended way to lose weight.  Eating too few calories can decrease your metabolism, strength, and performance on the court and in the classroom.</p> 
                
                <br>
                <p class="knewave">5 Things That Happen to Your Body When You Stop Exercising</p>
                
                <p>1) <span class="underline">Your blood pressure soars</span>: When you skip any form of physical exercise, your blood vessels adapt, increasing your blood pressure a couple of notches after just two weeks of missed workouts.</p>
                
                <p>2) <span class="underline">Lost of Strength</span>: After 3 days of missed activity, your body will begin changing.  Your body mass will start to decrease and fibers will lose their fat burning capabilities.  Also your muscles will fatigue faster.  Your abdomen muscles that are rarely used in day to day life are the fastest to lose tone.</p>
                
                <p>3) <span class="underline">Body Weight and Fat Gains</span>: If you are going from somewhat of a workout plan back into the sedentary lifestyle, you'll quickly notice increases in body fat.</p>
                
                <p>4) <span class="underline">Your Blood Sugar Jumps</span>: After five days of missed workouts, your blood sugar will rise.  Typically your blood glucose rises after you eat and then drops down as your muscles and other tissue absorb the sugar they need for energy. If you've been missing workouts, your post meal blood sugar levels will remain elevated. Continuously increasing blood sugar readings can actually raise the risk of heart disease and diabetes.</p>
                
                <p>5) <span class="underline">Mood Shifts</span>: Exercise has the ability to improve your mood and actually suppresses chemicals in the brain that cause depression by releasing other chemicals that lessen depression.  By missing workouts, you will feel sluggish and self conscious about your physical appearance as you lose strength and the weight starts to increase.</p>
