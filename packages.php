                <p class="impact center_packages">Used on individuals, groups and teams. <a data-scroll href="#anchor"><span class="rwd_break_880"><br></span>See below</a> for pricing.</p>

                <br>
                
                <p>Fit One Ball is available to provide one on one and team basketball training for all skill levels: junior high, high school, college and pros.  If you want to improve your game, you need to know your weaknesses.</p>  

                <p>The training is more than just basketball. We set you up with a schedule for your academics as well as break down your game.</p>

                <p>We work with you on fundamentals from scratch to help you to  become a complete student athlete and complete player. We will work on conditioning, help you to gain focus, speed, agility, help you with your shooting technique, defense stance and help you to become comfortable with your game.</p>

                <p>You will get information on NCAA requirements, Clearinghouse regulations, exposure games, and a wealth of information that is not provided by the average high school.</p>

                <p>When you work with me you have to set goals, you have to make sacrifices, and you have to be serious. If you do these 3 things you are on your way to becoming a complete player.</p>

                <p>All workouts are five days a week, 3 days minimum, and are 1 1/2 hour long For maximum results all packages are four to eight weeks long. This will give each player time to understand what complete training is all about. In addition, it will give players enough time to see how their bodies are going to feel week by week, on and off the court, and aids in helping players to see their results after a period of time.</p>
                
                <p>Having workouts for a month or more helps players gain trust that their bodies are being taken care of.</p>
