                <p class="knewave">Snack Tips:</p>
                
                <p>Carbohydrates are the major source of fuel for muscles.  Athletes should consume high quality carbs throughout the day to maintain optimum energy levels.</p>
                
                <p>High quality carbs are whole wheat bread, oatmeal and barley (cereals), rice, potatoes, beans, dried fruit, and fresh fruit.</p>
                
                <p>Consuming high quality lean protein throughout the day is essential for effective recovery and repair of damaged muscle tissue.</p>
                
                <p>High quality lean sources of protein are meats that are grilled, baked, or broiled, fish, chicken, turkey, seafood, egg whites, and lean beef such as round, sirloin, and fillet.</p>
                
                <p>Fat is not a good source of energy.  It takes a long time to digest and break down into energy.  Fat intake should be moderate throughout the day.</p>
                
                <p><span class="knewave">Drink plenty of fluids.</span>  This will help prevent dehydration, fatigue, and muscle cramps.  This is extremely important before, during, and after a game practice or workout. Always remember, under eating or not eating enough calories is not a safe and recommended way to lose weight.  Eating too few calories can decrease your metabolism, strength, and performance on the court and in the classroom.</p>
